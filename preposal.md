# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

TODO I want to make a game but I'm still conflicted on the type I want to go for. 
I definetly want it to fit under the roguelike category but not sure in what way.

I'm hovering something like vampire survivor or a platform with stages like a dungeon crawler in pygame.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

TODO Just me

## Do you have any questions of your own?

TODO Are we supposed to make our own assets?
