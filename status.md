Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

TODO I have made a working vampire survivor esque game using assets given in a pack I found online. It allows me to attack and spawns enemies that target the player and spawn on an interval. I made the hitboxes and collisions smoother or as smooth as I possibly can get it to be with my knowledge. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

TODO I want to make custom sprites and models instead of these free assets 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

TODO I am having trouble just learning pygame in general it's very tedious in a way but I guess that is normal with coding. It is a bit challenging remembering everything I learned. Things like remembering to call things for instance I forget to call a .convert_alpha(). I always forget the () and it holds up my coding for a long time and when I finally find it, it makes me feel so relieved and annoyed but I do love that feeling.
