# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO Bloonsday (like Doomsday)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO Vampire survior type gameplay but more monkey themed like bloons tower defense games. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO I'm still a bit conflicted of software and am still doing active research, but right now im thinking of unreal, unity, pygame, or godot. I will have levels or some sort of progression that makes the player stronger with upgrades as it faces a swarm of enemies that get progressivly stronger with time. I plan to make bosses at certain time intervals. I wish for the player to be placed in a destroyed monkey village as he wakes up and gets greeted with power ups to survive. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO NO MATTER WHAT: I will have a moveable sprite with enemies and death animations. A scaling system for the player

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO A better outcome would be to animate and make sprite sheets for aniamtions. I would like to be able to make bosses with different attack patterns. Same with normal enimies, I would like to make unique ones. Creating a save file for the player so I can make a more in depth experience where certain upgrades are locked behind playtime or how far they get. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO The best outcome would be to get the game running with 15 minutes time limit for everyrun and 3 boses at each 5 minutes. Events happen periodically at certain intervals. An immense amount of upgrade paths. I would also love to make different classes for the player. A statistics page of damage dealt by the player and the upgrades would also be something I hope I am able to do. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO I plan to learn a software and follow tutorials to make other tiny games before I jump into this. Like pygames I am trying to make a space shooter type game to understand the basis of the tool. After learning a software I would like to make pixel art for my game or use open source and copy right free sprite sheets for animations or assets. After getting the assets I would begin coding and allow friends to test to see what areas I need to flesh out and improve on.
